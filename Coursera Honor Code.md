You need to follow Courseraâ€™s Honor Code to uphold Coursera's standard of academic integrity:

* Register for only one account. Your account is linked to your email address. If you register on our site with more than one email address, you are registering for more than one account. If you have already registered for two accounts, please contact us using the contact form at the bottom of this page.
* Your answers to homework, quizzes, and exams must be your own work (except for assignments that explicitly permit collaboration).
* You may not share your solutions to homework, quizzes, or exams with anyone else unless explicitly permitted by the instructor. This includes anything written by you, as well as any official solutions provided by the course staff.
* You may not engage in any other activities that will dishonestly improve your results or dishonestly improve or damage the results of others.

## Plagiarism
Plagiarism is when you copy words, ideas, or any other materials from another source without giving credit. Plagiarism is unacceptable in any academic environment, and is a serious violation of Coursera's Honor Code.
